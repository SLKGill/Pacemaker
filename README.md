# pacemaker

A pacemaker device is being designed by creating real-time software on a hardware platform: NXP FRDM K-64. Pacemaker design implementation is carried through MATLAB Simulink and a corresponding Digital Communications Module is developed in Python for serial communication between the hardware and software. charts. The purpose of this pacemaker is to support the needs of patients that require bradycardia pacing support, alongside other irregularities that may cause the heartbeat to
differ from the desired rate. The modes that are implemented are AOO, VOO, AAI, VVI, DOO, AOOR, VOOR, AAIR, VVIR, and DOOR.

This project was completed in a group over a semester long project completely virtually. The complete software design process was executed including full documentation and testing of each software component.
